# Applying machine learning algorithms to a dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
The task is to predict the outcome of diabetes diagnosis based on various health-related features using different machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

## Part 1: Data Preprocessing
### Dataset:

The dataset contains health-related features such as:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Outcome

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to gain insights into the data. This includes:
Using functions like info(), describe().
Visualizing the distribution of data and relationships between features using scatter plots, hexbin plots, and histograms.

### Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values and normalize or standardize numerical data where necessary.
Convert any categorical data into numerical form (if applicable).

## Part 2: Model Training and Evaluation
### Machine Learning Models:

Train multiple models, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Use Scikit-learn for model training.
### Handling Overfitting:

Use techniques like GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Evaluate models using performance metrics such as:
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy.
### Validation and Testing:

Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets to evaluate model performance.
Compare results from different models and fine-tune them to improve accuracy.
## Part 3: Advanced Techniques
### Random Forests:

Implement Random Forest as an ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
Compare Decision Trees with Random Forest in terms of bias and variance.
### Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like Grid Search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for each model.
